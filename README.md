## Independent Activity 1 - Intro To Express

### Make sure you have completed Guided Activity 2 first

Your company has decided that the built-in http module that comes with Node.JS is no longer sufficient to meet the needs of the application. Port your Guided Activity 1 assignment over to use Express instead of the built in http module. You may re-use majority of the code from Guided Activity 1. 

### Complete the following:

1. Create a new node project with npm
2. Install Express via NPM
3. All of the modules and html you created in for Guided Actuvity 2 can be re-used here.
4. Modify the server.js so that is uses express instead of HTTP.

### Testing Your Server

1. **Run Your Server:**
   - In the terminal, start your server:
     ```bash
     node server.js
     ```
   - Your server is now live on `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Test Each Endpoint:**
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000/` in a web browser for your student details.
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/system-info` for system info.
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/log-visit` to log your visit.
   - Check `http://localhost:3000/show-log` to view the log.
